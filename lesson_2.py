#Home work 2 pn Python variables
# Define the variables
a = 5
b = 3
c = 10
# Compute and print the logical output
print(a + b * c == 80) # This produce false
print(a / b + c == 5 / 13) # This also produce false and 11.67 as the answer instead

#After creating another branch, i repeat the task as follows:
print((a + b) * c == 80) # This produce True now
print(a / (b + c) == 5 / 13) # This also true as well
