# Home work 2 pn Python variables
# Task1
# Define the variables
a = 5
b = 3
c = 10
# Compute and print the logical output
print(a + b * c == 80)  # This produce false
print(a / b + c == 5 / 13)  # This also produce false and 11.67 as the answer instead

# TAsk 2
# After creating another branch, i repeat the task as follows:
print((a + b) * c == 80)  # This produce True now
print(a / (b + c) == 5 / 13)  # This also true as well

##Task: Kinting and formatter
# using ctrl+shift +M, No problems have been detected  in workspacelesoo
# using black, typed "black lesson_2.py"
